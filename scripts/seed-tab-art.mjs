/**
 * Uploads the curated artwork the category tabs use for their recipient
 * circles and entry tiles.
 *
 * WHY THESE SLOTS NEED ARTWORK AT ALL
 *
 * Until now every decorative image on a tab was borrowed from whichever
 * product happened to match the label. For a "Rings" circle that is exactly
 * right — the picture is of a ring. For a RECIPIENT circle it is not: "For
 * Him" on the Fashion tab picked the first product tagged `him`, which was a
 * girls' t-shirt, and on Perfume & Beauty nothing was tagged `father` at all,
 * so the Dad circle rendered empty. A row of seven recipients also has to read
 * as seven different people at a glance, and seven photographs chosen by seven
 * independent queries never will.
 *
 * So recipients and tiles are curated: one deliberate image per slot, the same
 * on every tab, chosen against the house rules — the image shows the labelled
 * thing, it is a gift item rather than a lifestyle scene, and it carries no
 * baked-in text, price, watermark or real brand mark.
 *
 * WHAT WAS REJECTED, so nobody re-picks it:
 *   1787074634411  mom     — brand labels across every bottle in the set
 *   1643122941450  mom     — "Scented Candle Jar" printed on each lid
 *   1681183183805  partner — a "Pralines" box, brand name front and centre
 *   1687471603664  partner — Arabic lettering moulded into the chocolates
 *   1777768785267  friend  — labelled honey jars
 *   1773450970959  ready   — "VERO" branded crate
 *   1773450970981  best    — same brand on the ribbon
 *   1781263538938  best    — Kit Kat, Dairy Milk and Galaxy wrappers
 *   1598634222670  dad     — legible brand on the bottle
